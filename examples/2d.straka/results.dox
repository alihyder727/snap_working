<h1> Results </h1>

We are going to make a plot of the result using python. The
program is `make_plots.py`. Execute it by:
@code
  python3 make_plots.py
@endcode
A file named `2d.straka-theta.png` will be generated. It shows the potential temperature
anomaly of the environment with respect to 300 K at four time steps.

The maximum potential temperature anomaly should be zero because the motion is adiabatic
and mimum potential temperature anomaly increases with time due to diffusion. The cold
air spreads out as expected and develops rolling vortices. The result
can be compared to Figure 3 of \cite straka1993.
